			<p>
				<span>Trapped amid the woods with guile</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They’ve led her hound in fetters vile</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To death, a deadlier sorceress</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than any born for earth’s distress</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since first the winner of the fleece</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bore home the Colchian witch to Greece⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seven months with snare and gin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They’ve sought the maid o’erwise within</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The forest’s labyrinthine shade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lonely woodman half afraid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far off her ragged form has seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sauntering down the alleys green,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or crouched in godless prayer alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At eve before a Druid stone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now the bitter chase is won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The quarry’s caught, her magic’s done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bishop’s brought her strongest spell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To naught with candle, book, and bell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With holy water splashed upon her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She goes to burning and dishonour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too deeply damned to feel her shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, though beneath her hair of flame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her thoughtful head be lowly bowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It droops for meditation proud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Impenitent, and pondering yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Things no memory can forget,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Starry wonders she has seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brooding in the wildwood green</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With holiness. For who can say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In what strange crew she loved to play,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What demons or what gods of old</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deep mysteries unto her have told</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At dead of night in worship bent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At ruined shrines magnificent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or how the quivering will she sent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alone into the great alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where all is loved and all is known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who now lifts up her maiden eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And looks around with soft surprise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the noisy, crowded square</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The city oafs that nod and stare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bishop’s court that gathers there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The faggots and the blackened stake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where sinners die for justice’ sake?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now she is set upon the pile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mob grows still a little while,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till lo! before the eager folk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Up curls a thin, blue line of smoke.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Alas!” the full-fed burghers cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“That evil loveliness must die!”</span>
