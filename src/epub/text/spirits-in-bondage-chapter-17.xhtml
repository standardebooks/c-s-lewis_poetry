			<p>
				<span>O leave the labouring roadways of the town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shifting faces and the changeful hue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of markets, and broad echoing streets that drown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heart's own silent music. Though they too</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing in their proper rhythm, and still delight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The friendly ear that loves warm human kind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet it is good to leave them all behind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now when from lily dawn to purple night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Summer is queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Summer is queen in all the happy land</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far, far away among the valleys green</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let us go forth and wander hand in hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond those solemn hills that we have seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So often welcome home the falling sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into their cloudy peaks when day was doneâ€”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond them till we find the ocean strand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hear the great waves run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the waste song whose melodies I'd follow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And weary not for many a summer day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Born of the vaulted breakers arching hollow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before they flash and scatter into spray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On, if we should be weary of their play</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then I would lead you further into land</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where, with their ragged walls, the stately rocks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shunt in smooth courts and paved with quiet sand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To silence dedicate. The sea-god's flocks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have rested here, and mortal eyes have seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By great adventure at the dead of noon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A lonely nereid drowsing half a-swoon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Buried beneath her dark and dripping locks.</span>
