			<p>
				<span>Three golden months while summer on us stole</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have read your joyful tale another time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breathing more freely in that larger clime</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And learning wiselier to deserve the whole.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Your Spirit, Master, has been close at hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And guided me, still pointing treasures rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thick-sown where I before saw nothing fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And finding waters in the barren land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Barren once thought because my eyes were dim.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like one I am grown to whom the common field</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And often-wandered copse one morning yield</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New pleasures suddenly; for over him</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Falls the weird spirit of unexplained delight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New mystery in every shady place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In every whispering tree a nameless grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New rapture on the windy seaward height.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So may she come to me, teaching me well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To savour all these sweets that lie to hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In wood and lane about this pleasant land</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though it be not the land where I would dwell.</span>
