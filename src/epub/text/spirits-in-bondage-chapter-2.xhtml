				<span>Long leagues on either hand the trenches spread</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all is still; now even this gross line</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drinks in the frosty silences divine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pale, green moon is riding overhead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The jaws of a sacked village, stark and grim;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out on the ridge have swallowed up the sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in one angry streak his blood has run</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To left and right along the horizon dim.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There comes a buzzing plane: and now, it seems</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flies straight into the moon. Lo! where he steers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across the pallid globe and surely nears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In that white land some harbour of dear dreams!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>False mocking fancy! Once I too could dream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who now can only see with vulgar eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he’s no nearer to the moon than I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she’s a stone that catches the sun’s beam.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What call have I to dream of anything?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am a wolf. Back to the world again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And speech of fellow-brutes that once were men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our throats can bark for slaughter: cannot sing.</span>
