			<p>
				<span>Suddenly there came to me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The music of a mighty sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That on a bare and iron shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thundered with a deeper roar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than all the tides that leap and run</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With us below the real sun:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because the place was far away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above, beyond our homely day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neighbouring close the frozen clime</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where out of all the woods of time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amid the frightful seraphim</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fierce, cold eyes of Godhead gleam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Revolving hate and misery</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wars and famines yet to be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in my dreams I stood alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon a shelf of weedy stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saw before my shrinking eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dark, enormous breakers rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hover and fall with deafening thunder</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of thwarted foam that echoed under</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ledge, through many a cavern drear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With hollow sounds of wintry fear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And through the waters waste and grey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thick-strown for many a league away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of the toiling sea arose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many a face and form of those</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thin, elemental people dear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who live beyond our heavy sphere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all at once from far and near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They all held out their arms to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crying in their melody,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Leap in! Leap in and take thy fill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all the cosmic good and ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be as the Living ones that know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enormous joy, enormous woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pain beyond thought and fiery bliss:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all thy study hunted this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On wings of magic to arise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wash from off thy filmed eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cloud of cold mortality,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To find the real life and be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As are the children of the deep!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be bold and dare the glorious leap,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or to thy shame, go, slink again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Back to the narrow ways of men.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So all these mocked me as I stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Striving to wake because I feared the flood.</span>
