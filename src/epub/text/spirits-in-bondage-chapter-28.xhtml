				<span>The big, red-house is bare and lone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The stony garden waste and sere</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With blight of breezes ocean blown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To pinch the wakening of the year</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My kindly friends with busy cheer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My wretchedness could plainly show.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They tell me I am lonely here⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What do they know? What do they know?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They think that while the gables moan</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And easements creak in winter drear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I should be piteously alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without the speech of comrades dear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And friendly for my sake they fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It grieves them thinking of me so</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While all their happy life is near⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What do they know? What do they know?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That I have seen the Dagda’s throne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In sunny lands without a tear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And found a forest all my own</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To ward with magic shield and spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where, through the stately towers I rear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For my desire, around me go</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Immortal shapes of beauty clear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They do not known, they do not knoe.</span>

					<span>The friends I have without a peer</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beyond the western ocean’s glow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wither the faerie galleys steer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They do not know: how should they know?</span>
