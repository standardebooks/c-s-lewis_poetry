				<span>I know a little Druid wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where I would slumber if I could</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And have the murmuring of the stream</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To mingle with a midnight dream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And have the holy hazel trees</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To play above me in the breeze,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And smell the thorny eglantine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For there the white owls all night long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the scented gloom divine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hear the wild, strange, tuneless song</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of faerie voices, thin and high</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the bat’s unearthly cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the measure of their shoon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dancing, dancing, under the moon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until, amid the pale of dawn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wandering stars begin to swoon⁠ ⁠…</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah, leave the world and come away!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The windy folk are in the glade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And men have seen their revels, laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In secret on some flowery lawn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Underneath the beechen covers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kings of old, I’ve heard them say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here have found them faerie lovers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That charmed them out of life and kissed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their lips with cold lips unafraid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And such a spell around them made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they have passed beyond the mist</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fount eh Country-under-wave⁠ ⁠…</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Kings of old, whom none could save!1</span>
