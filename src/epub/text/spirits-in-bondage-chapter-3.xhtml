			</hgroup>
			<p>
				<span>When the flowery hands of spring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forth their woodland riches fling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through the meadows, through the valleys</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Goes the satyr carolling.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From the mountain and the moor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forest green and ocean shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All the faerie kin he rallies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Making music evermore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>See! the shaggy pelt doth grow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On his twisted shanks below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And his dreadful feet are cloven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though his brow be white as snow⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though his brow be clear and white</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And beneath it fancies bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wisdom and high thoughts are woven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the musics of delight,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though his temples too be fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet two horns are growing there</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bursting forth to part asunder</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the riches of his hair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Faerie maidens he may meet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fly the horns and cloven feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, his sad brown eyes with wonder</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeing⁠—stay from their retreat.</span>
