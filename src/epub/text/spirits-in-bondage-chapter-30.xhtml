				<span>It is well that there are palaces of peace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And discipline and dreaming and desire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest we forget our heritage and cease</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Spirit’s work⁠—to hunger and aspire:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lest we forget that we were born divine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now tangled in red battle’s animal net,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Murder the work and lust the anodyne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pains of the beast ’gainst bestial solace set.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But this shall never be: to us remains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One city that has nothing of the beast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That was not built for gross, material gains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sharp, wolfish power or empire’s glutted feast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We are not wholly brute. To us remains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A clean, sweet city lulled by ancient streams,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A place of visions and of loosening chains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A refuge of the elect, a tower of dreams.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She was not builded out of common stone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But out of all men’s yearning and all prayer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That she might live, eternally our own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Spirit’s stronghold⁠—barred against despair.</span>
