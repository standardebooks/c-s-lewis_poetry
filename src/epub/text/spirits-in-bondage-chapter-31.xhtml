				<span>All the things magicians do</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could be done by me and you</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freely, if we only knew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Human children every day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could play at games the faeries play</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If they were but shown the way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Every man a God would be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laughing through eternity</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If as God's his eyes could see.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All the wizardries of God—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slaying matter with a nod,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Charming spirits with his rod,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With the singing of his voice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Making lonely lands rejoice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaving us no will nor choice,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Drawing headlong me and you</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the piping Orpheus drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Man and beast the mountains through,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By the sweetness of his horn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Calling us from lands forlorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nearer to the widening morn—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All that loveliness of power</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could be man's peculiar dower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even mine, this very hour;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We should reach the Hidden Land</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And grow immortal out of hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If we could but understand!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We could revel day and night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all power and all delight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If we learn to think aright.</span>
