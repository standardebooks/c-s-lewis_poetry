			<p>
				<span>We need no barbarous words nor solemn spell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To raise the unknown. It lies before our feet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There have been men who sank down into Hell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In some suburban street,0</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And some there are that in their daily walks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have met archangels fresh from sight of God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or watched how in their beans and cabbage-stalks</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Long files of faerie trod.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Often me too the Living voices call</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In many a vulgar and habitual place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I catch a sight of lands beyond the wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I see a strange god’s face.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And some day this work will work upon me so</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall arise and leave both friends and home</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And over many lands a pilgrim go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through alien woods and foam,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Seeking the last steep edges of the earth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence I may leap into that gulf of light</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherein, before my narrowing Self had birth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Part of me lived aright.</span>
