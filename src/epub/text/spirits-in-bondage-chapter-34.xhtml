			</hgroup>
			<p>
				<span>I stand on the windy uplands among the hills of Down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all the world spread out beneath, meadow and sea and town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ploughlands on the far-off hills that glow with friendly brown.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And ever across the rolling land to the far horizon line,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the blue hills border the misty west, I see the white roads twine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rare roads and the fair roads that call this heart of mine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I see them dip in the valleys and vanish and rise and bend</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From shadowy dell to windswept fell, and still to the West they wend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And over the cold blue ridge at last to the great world’s uttermost end.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And the call of the roads is upon me, a desire in my spirit has grown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To wander forth in the highways, ’twixt earth and sky alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seek for the lands no foot has trod and the seas no sail had known:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>—For the lands to the west of the evening and east of the morning’s birth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the gods unseen in their valleys green are glad at the ends of the earth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fear no morrow to bring them sorrow, nor night to quench their mirth.</span>
