			<p>
				<span>A place uplifted towards the midnight sky</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far, far away among the mountains old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A treeless waste of rocks and freezing cold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the dead, cheerless moon rode neighbouring by⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the midst a silent tarn there lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A narrow pool, cold as the tide that flows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where monstrous bergs beyond Varanger stray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rising from sunless depths that no man knows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thither as clustering fireflies have I seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At fixed seasons all the stars come down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To wash in that cold wave their brightness clean</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And win the special fire wherewith they crown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wintry heavens in frost. Even as a flock</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of falling birds, down to the pool they came.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw them and I heard the icy shock</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of stars engulfed with hissing of faint flame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>—Ages ago before the birth of men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or earliest beast. Yet I was still the same</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That now remember, knowing not where or when.</span>
