				<span>For all the lore of Lodge and Myers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I cannot heal my torn desires,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor hope for all that man can speer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make the riddling earth grow clear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though it were sure and proven well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I shall prosper, as they tell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In fields beneath a different sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By shores where other oceans run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When this live body that was I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lies hidden from the cheerful sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet what were endless lives to me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If still my narrow self I be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hope and fail and struggle still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And break my will against God’s will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To play for stakes of pleasure and pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hope and fail and hope again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And break my will against God’s will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To play for stakes of pleasure and pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hope and fail and hope again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deluded, thwarted, striving elf</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That through the window of my self</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As through a dark glass scarce can see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A warped and masked reality?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when this searching thought of mine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is mingled in the large Divine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And laughter that was in my mouth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Runs through the breezes of the South,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When glory I have built in dreams</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Along some fiery sunset gleams,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And my dead sin and foolishness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grow one with Nature’s whole distress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To perfect being I shall win,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And where I end will Life begin.</span>
