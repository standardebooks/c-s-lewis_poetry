			<p>
				<span>Roland is dead, Cuchulain’s crest is low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The battered war-rear wastes and turns to rust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Helen’s eyes and Iseult’s lips are dust</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dust the shoulders and the breasts of snow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The faerie people from our woods are gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No Dryads have I found in all our trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No Triton blows his horn about our seas</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Arthur sleeps far hence in Avalon.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The ancient songs they wither as the grass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And waste as doth a garment waxen old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All poets have been fools who thought to mould</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A monument more durable than brass.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For these decay: but not for that decays</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The yearning, high, rebellious spirit of man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That never rested yet since life began</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From striving with red Nature and her ways.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now in the filth of war, the baresark shout</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of battle, it is vexed. And yet so oft</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of the deeps, of old, it rose aloft</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they who watch the ages may not doubt.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though often bruised, oft broken by the rod,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet, like the phoenix, from each fiery bed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Higher the stricken spirit lifts its head</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And higher⁠—till the beast become a god.</span>
