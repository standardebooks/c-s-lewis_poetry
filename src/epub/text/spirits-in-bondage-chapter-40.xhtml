				<span>Open the gates for me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Open the gates of the peaceful castle, rosy in the West,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the sweet dim Isle of Apples over the wide sea’s breast</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Open the gates for me!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sorely pressed have I been</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And driven and hurt beyond bearing this summer day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the heat and the pain together suddenly fall away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All’s cool and green.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But a moment agone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among men cursing in fight and toiling, blinded I fought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the labour passed on a sudden even as a passing though,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And now⁠—alone!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah, to be ever alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In flowery valleys among the mountains and silent wastes untrod,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the dewy upland places, in the garden of God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This would atone!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I shall not see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The brutal, crowded faces around me, that in their toil have grown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into the faces of devils⁠—yea, even as my own⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When I find thee,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O Country of Dreams!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond the tide of the ocean, hidden and sunk away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of the sound of battles, near to the end of day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full of dim woods and streams.</span>
