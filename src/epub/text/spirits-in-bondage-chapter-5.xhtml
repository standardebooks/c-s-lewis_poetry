			<p>
				<span>Now the grey mist comes creeping up</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the waste ocean’s weedy strand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fills the valley, as a cup</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If filled of evil drink in a wizard’s hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the trees fade out of sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like dreary ghosts unhealthily</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into the damp, pale night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till you almost think that a clearer eye could see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some shape come up of a demon seeking apart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His meat, as Grendel sought in Harte</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The thanes that at by the wintry log⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grendel or the shadowy mass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Balor, or the man with the face of clay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The grey, grey walker who used to pass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over the rock-arch nightly to his prey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But here at the dumb, slow stream where the willows hang,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With never a wind to blow the mists apart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bitter and bitter it is for thee. O my heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looking upon this land, where poets sang,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus with the dreary shroud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unwholesome, over it spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And knowing the fog and the cloud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her people’s heart and head</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even as it lies for ever upon her coasts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Making them dim and dreamy lest her sons should ever arise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And remember all their boasts;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I know that the colourless skies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the blurred horizons breed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lonely desire and many words and brooding and never a deed.</span>
