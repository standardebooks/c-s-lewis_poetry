				<span>Last night I dreamed that I was come again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto the house where my beloved dwells</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After long years of wandering and pain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And I stood out beneath the drenching rain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the street was bare, and black with night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in my true love's house was warmth and light.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet I could not draw near nor enter in,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And long I wondered if some secret sin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or old, unhappy anger held me fast;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Till suddenly it came into my head</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I was killed long since and lying deadâ€”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only a homeless wraith that way had passed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So thus I found my true love's house again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stood unseen amid the winter night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the lamp burned within, a rosy light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the wet street was shining in the rain.</span>
