				<span>If men should ask, Despoina, why I tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of nothing glad nor noble in my verse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To lighten hearts beneath this present curse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And build a heaven of dreams in real hell,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Go you to them and speak among them thus:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“There were no greater grief than to recall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down in the rotting grave where the lithe worms crawl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Green fields above that smiled so sweet to us.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Is it good to tell old tales of Troynovant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or praises of dead heroes, tried and sage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or sing the queens of unforgotten age,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brynhild and Maeve and virgin Bradamant?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>How should I sing of them? Can it be good</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To think of glory now, when all is done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all our labour underneath the sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has brought us this⁠—and not the thing we would?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All these were rosy visions of the night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The loveliness and wisdom feigned of old.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now we wake. The East is pale and cold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No hope is in the dawn, and no delight.</span>
