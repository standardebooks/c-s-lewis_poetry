			<p>
				<span>After the fret and failure of this day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And weariness of thought, O Mother Night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come with soft kiss to soothe our care away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all our little tumults set to right;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Most pitiful of all death’s kindred fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Riding above us through the curtained air</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On thy dusk car, thou scatterest to the earth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet dreams and drowsy charms of tender might</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lovers’ dear delight before to-morrow’s birth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus art thou wont thy quiet lands to leave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pillared courts beyond the Milky Way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherein thou tarriest all our solar day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While unsubstantial dreams before thee weave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A foamy dance, and fluttering fancies play</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About thy palace in the silver ray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of some far, moony globe. But when the hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The long-expected comes, the ivory gates</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Open on noiseless hinge before thy bower</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unbidden, and the jewelled chariot waits</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With magic steeds. Thou from the fronting rim</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bending to urge them, whilst thy sea-dark hair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Falls in ambrosial ripples o’er each limb,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With beautiful pale arms, untrammelled, bare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For horsemanship to those twin chargers fleet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dost give full reign across the fires that flow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the wide floor of heaven, from off their feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scattering the powdery star-dust as they go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come swiftly down the sky, O Lady Night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fall through the shadow-country, O most kind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shake out thy strands of gentle dreams and light</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For chains, wherewith thou still art used to bind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With tenderest love of careful leeches’ art</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bruised and weary heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In slumber blind.</span>
