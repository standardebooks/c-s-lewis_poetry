			<p>
				<span>As of old Phoenician men, to the Tin Isles sailing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straight against the sunset and the edges of the earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chaunted loud above the storm and the strange sea’s wailing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Legends of their people and the land that gave them birth⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang aloud to Baal-Peor, sang unto the horned maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang how they should come again with the Brethon treasure laden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang of all the pride and glory of their hardy enterprise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How they found the outer islands, where the unknown stars arise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the rowers down below, rowing hard as they could row,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toiling at the stroke and feather through the wet and wary weather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even they forgot their burden in the measure of a song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the merchants and the masters and the bondsmen all together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dreaming of the wondrous islands, brought the gallant ship along;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So in mighty deeps alone on the chainless breezes blown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In my oracle of verses I will sing of lands unknown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flying from the scarlet city where a Lord that knows no pity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mocks the broken people praying round his iron throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>—Sing about the Hidden Country fresh and full of quiet green.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sailing over seas uncharted to a port that none has seen.</span>
